# ML-Project-Name-Gender-Classification-With-Machine-Learning
A name is one of many features that a language has which functions as identifier of an individual. We could observe patterns emerge from names that could lead us to classify individuals. For example, we could tell whether a person is male or female just by knowing his/her names. Another classification that might be able to deduced from names are race, nationality, social class, etc. In this project, we focus on how to recognize gender solely from the knowledge of names. We employ two well-known machine learning classification algorithms, the Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB) and Random Forrest (RF), and compare both performances.
